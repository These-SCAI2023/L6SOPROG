ABSTRACT={<p>In the past decade, the emergence of machine learning (ML) applications has led to significant advances towards implementation of personalised medicine approaches for improved health care, due to the exceptional performance of ML models when utilising complex big data. The immune-mediated chronic inflammatory diseases are a group of complex disorders associated with dysregulated immune responses resulting in inflammation affecting various organs and systems. The heterogeneous nature of these diseases poses great challenges for tailored disease management and addressing unmet patient needs. Applying novel ML techniques to the clinical study of chronic inflammatory diseases shows promising results and great potential for precision medicine applications in clinical research and practice. In this review, we highlight the clinical applications of various ML techniques for prediction, diagnosis and prognosis of autoimmune rheumatic diseases, inflammatory bowel disease, autoimmune chronic kidney disease, and multiple sclerosis, as well as ML applications for patient stratification and treatment selection. We highlight the use of ML in drug development, including target identification, validation and drug repurposing, as well as challenges related to data interpretation and validation, and ethical concerns related to the use of artificial intelligence in clinical research.</p>}}

abstract = {Cluster analysis is an essential tool in data mining. Several clustering algorithms have been proposed and implemented, most of which are able to find good quality clustering results. However, the majority of the traditional clustering algorithms, such as the K-means, K-medoids, and Chameleon, still depend on being provided a priori with the number of clusters and may struggle to deal with problems where the number of clusters is unknown. This lack of vital information may impose some additional computational burdens or requirements on the relevant clustering algorithms. In real-world data clustering analysis problems, the number of clusters in data objects cannot easily be preidentified and so determining the optimal amount of clusters for a dataset of high density and dimensionality is quite a difficult task. Therefore, sophisticated automatic clustering techniques are indispensable because of their flexibility and effectiveness. This paper presents a systematic taxonomical overview and bibliometric analysis of the trends and progress in nature-inspired metaheuristic clustering approaches from the early attempts in the 1990s until today’s novel solutions. Finally, key issues with the formulation of metaheuristic algorithms as a clustering problem and major application areas are also&nbsp;covered in this paper.},
